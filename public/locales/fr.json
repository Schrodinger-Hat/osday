      "talk": "Open Source has both “won” and “lost” at the same time. Every company in the world leverages Open Source Software (OSS) to build products. However, every software is vulnerable, and OSS is no exception. Yet, despite the strong incentive for companies all over the world to discover and fix them, the majority use open source without paying for it.\n\n Security scanners allow companies to discover vulnerable OSS they depend upon, but those vulnerabilities should also be fixed. While there are some incentives in discovering security vulnerabilities via bounty programs, there are none to fix them. A typical email to an OSS maintainer is more like a threat: if you do not fix it in the next month or so, I am going to make this public.\n\n In Node.js we have experimented with a public bounty program with https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg, and several companies sponsor full-time researchers to discover vulnerabilities. However, the OSS maintainers receive no compensation for their time in fixing the vulnerability. How can we solve this conundrum?",

Examples include: the network provider drops the connection, the application crashes or a technician unplugs and plugs the device back in, power cuts, low battery life.\n\n Building resilience in your application is the solution to ensuring reliability, and it is your responsibility, as an engineer, to build resilience in your IoT application. This session will look at application resilience at edge, and using open source tools to achieve this. We will focus on MQTT connection resilience, message delivery, and application runtime resilience.",

      "talk": "As the modern cloud grows in complexity, container security based on attack prevention and surface reduction become less effective. Most new cloud environments collect activity logs and store them for later inspection, which consumes lots of storage and loses the benefits of runtime visibility, or apply fine-grained runtime control on access and operations, which is more intrusive and brings scalability concerns.\n\n Falco, the Cloud Native Runtime Security tool, offers an open source alternative based on non-invasive runtime detection and low resource consumption. Falco is like a security camera that observes all the activity in your system and alerts you whenever suspicious behavior is detected. Historically, Falco was focused on containers and system security by observing data coming from the Linux kernel, but has more recently evolved to also bring real-time telemetry over logs of cloud services.\n\n In this talk, you’ll learn the basics of the project and how you can employ it as an open-source all-in-one solution for detecting malicious attacks in a faster and cost-effective manner and for securing your applications and cloud infrastructure.",

Today more than ever, proper configuration and enforcement of access control are critical to modern organizations, as privacy and compliance awareness are at their peak.\n\n Yet, building authorization or permissions management is a painful process for developers.

OPAL detects changes to both policy and policy data in real-time and pushes live updates to policy engines, making them real-time and event-driven. OPAL uses Git as the source-of-truth for policy, enabling Git Ops workflow for policy delivery and versioning.\n Today, OPAL is used by thousands of engineers, including developers from Tesla, Zapier, Cisco, and Accenture.\n\n In his talk, Filip Grebowski will explain the challenges of managing modern authorization and access control and how these challenges can be solved by using open source tools like OPAL.
